# dbpiblock
Fork of the jcblock_log_to_MySQL program modified to run locally on a raspberrypi with some enhancements.

This is a fork of the jcblock_log_to_MySQL project by Thomas Miller (https://github.com/tomjavamiller/jcblock_log_to_MySQL).

I use it to keep a complete record of the callerID log.  It is run as a prerotation script for logrotate and adds the months callers to a MySQL database. It creates a report showing the all time total of each junk call number.
Like the original author, I have a telephone feature that allows me to block a limited number of calling numbers (10), so that they do not even ring in. I would like to find the most persistant junk callers to include on that short list. Also, keeping a complete callerID history may prove to be beneficial.

The program may be run manually to create a current report.

07/07/16 - Initial commit

1) Changed the callerID retrieval to perform a local copy of the callerID log rather than a remote fetch via scp. Added code to handle piblock's extended call tags and changed sort order so that the most persistant caller is on top. The program will still run against a standard jcblock installation without piblock's modifications.

2) Added an optional command line argument to limit output to callers who have called X number of times. 
   Ex: python getcall.py 4, shows the blacklisted callers who have called 4 or more times historically.
		
3) Created an INSTALL readme for getting the program running on the raspberrypi. It requires the installation of several supporting packages and some initial database administration.

4) Created a /etc/logrotate/piblock config file to run this program before archiving the callerID log and create a current cidreport.log in the program directory.

5) Added code to format the phone number in the output table, using the python port of Google's libphonenumber. Requires the installation of the phonenumberslite python module. See the INSTALL readme.

6) Added code to use the tabulate python module to format program output. Added an optional second argument to instruct program to output in HTML format.  Requires the installation of the tabulate python module. See the INSTALL readme.
Ex: python getcall.py html, formats output as HTML; python getcall.py 4 html, limits output to callers who have called 4 or more times historically and formats output as HTML. 
I am using Exim and bsd-mailx on the raspberrypi to email the log monthly via Gmail in HTML format.

7) Added code to display the date that the number had last called in the output table. Changed the table sort to order by count, then by date.
Improved the formatting of the HTML table output.
