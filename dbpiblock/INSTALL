Step 1: INSTALLATION

Copy the dbpiblock files to a separate directory. 

Install the required software and python modules on Raspberian.

Install the SQLAlchemy python module;
$ sudo pip install SQLAlchemy

Install the pymysql python module;
$ sudo pip install pymysql

Install the phonenumbers python module;
$ sudo pip install phonenumbers

Install the MySQL program and python API extensions;
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server python-mysqldb

Note: At the completion of the program's install you will be prompted to provide a password for the database "root" user.

Step 2: CONFIGURATION 

Create a database user and an empty callerid database.

Log into MySQL as the "root" user, enter the password you chose when prompted.
$ mysql -u root -p

At the database prompt create a user with the same name as your raspberrypi login account. The database password can and should be different from your login account. In the line below substitute your account name for pi and your chosen password instead of the word password. 
mysql> CREATE USER 'pi'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Create the empty database.
mysql> CREATE DATABASE callerid;

Switch to the newly created database.
mysql> USE callerid;

Give your local account full access to the callerid database, substitute your account name for pi in the command.
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON callerid.* TO 'pi'@'localhost';

Update database privileges.
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Exit the database.
mysql> quit

Edit the getcall.py program to configure program paths and callerid database credentials. See the two comment lines tagged with "********* EDIT" within the program.

Using with piblock: Copy the logrotate.d/piblock config to /etc/logrotate.d/piblock to enable exectution before the  callerID.dat logfile is archived.

Running manually: python getcall.py [minimum calltimes to display] Example: To display the blacklisted callers who have called 4 or more times historically; python getcall.py 4
