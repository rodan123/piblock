# The first field is the one tested. It can be the telephone number or some other
# field in the caller ID string. It *must be* terminated with a '?' character.
# The Date-of-last-accept field starts in the 20th column. Be sure to replace the
# '------' characters (shown in the examples below) with the current date in
# format MMDDYY so that room to store the date is present on the line. The rest
# of the line (out to 80 chars) can contain a comment of your choosing. Any
# change you make will be recognized by a running jcblock program.
# ******Do not use tabs in the entries!!******
# Examples (without the initial '#' chars!):
#8005551212?        ------         your best friend's home number
#5081232121?        ------         your best friend's cell phone number
#                  | <---- the 20th column
